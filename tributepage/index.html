      <p>Success is not just about hard work, it's about dedication to the task at hand,
        the determination to see it through, and the passion to make a difference. The price of success is hard work, 
        dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, 
        we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.</p>
